"""Write ../clean.py from ../sheets/specv1.md: one function per disease code, each rule's code unchanged, and one
scope table at the top that says which packs each rule applies to.

  python -I build_clean.py [--sheet ../sheets/specv1.md] [--out ../clean.py]

DA- and DB- rule IDs are accepted. DEFERRED cards use non-executable `python deferred` fences and are inventoried
in DEFERRED_RULES, not emitted as active rules. Indic _PACKS guards are intersected with SPEC_PACKS as well.

specv1.md has one "## Medicine N — <family> / <code> / `<ID>`" section per rule, each with one python block. A block names
its packs in SPEC_PACKS, and a math block checks its ORIGIN packs too (PACKS); the scope is what both allow. The build
moves those pack IDs into SCOPE and points SPEC_PACKS and PACKS at it, so pack IDs are written once. A document goes to the
family of its pack_id and runs that family's rules in sheet order; a missing or unknown pack_id passes unchanged.

Each rule block goes into its own closure, so helpers with the same name in two blocks do not clash. Prints any string
that indenting a block changed: only a multi-line string can change, and a docstring or a verbose regex does not care.

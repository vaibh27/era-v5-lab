"""Does F1 work on the English packs? The English counterpart of f1_eval.py. IDs, counts and made-up values only.

  python -I f1_eval_english.py <g1-harm-test checkout> <packs dir> [docs per pack for planting, default 40]

../clean.py's f1() runs DA-F1-005 on the English packs (its SCOPE); the shared f1_rule.py runs on the code packs
only. Each check is also made with the shared rule, switched on for en and eng in memory only (prose has no tree, so regex
alone decides), to show what switching it on would do. Neither file is changed.

  1 real      F1 hits per pack after the rules before it: docs changed or dropped, gold docs touched, tags by kind
  2 planted   made-up details (f1_eval.py's values) on a line of their own at the end of real gold docs: the right tag
              and nothing else changed; organisations and look-alikes kept
  3 again     a second clean() leaves every F1 tag as it is

Writes ../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/f1_eval_english.json.

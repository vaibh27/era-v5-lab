"""Run each function of ../clean.py, and each English medicine, on each English gold set with the team's harm_test.py,
and write ../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/harm_tests_english.md: the English packs in more detail than make_harm_tests.py,
which writes ../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/harm_tests.md for every pack.

  python -I make_harm_tests_english.py <g1-harm-test checkout> <packs dir> <gold dir with the disputed docs left in>

harm_test.py is run as it is, never changed. Four runs per pack, reports in ../../results/spec_v1/ (IDs and digests only):
  cleaner/clean_<pack>_harm.json         ../clean.py --rule all, official gold: each function, then ALL IN ORDER in RULES order
  cleaner/clean_stress_<pack>_harm.json  the same, with the disputed docs left in
  sheets/<pack>_harm.json                ../sheets/medicine_english.md --rule all, official gold: each medicine, then the sheet
  sheets/stress_<pack>_harm.json         the same, with the disputed docs left in
The packs carry pack_id, which clean.py needs to pick the English rules. Section 4 of harm_tests_english.md comes from
../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/verify_clean_english.json and section 5 from ../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/f1_eval_english.json: run those two scripts first.

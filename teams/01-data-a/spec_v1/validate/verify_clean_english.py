"""Check ../clean.py against the English rules of ../sheets/specv1.md (the sheet it is built from) on every document of the English
packs. Prints IDs and counts only, never text.

  python -I verify_clean_english.py <packs dir>

  1 each ../clean.py function gives what that code's English blocks give, run in order; a function with no English rule keeps
  2 ../clean.py's clean(doc) gives what the English blocks give, run in sheet order (the sheet as harm_test.py tests it)
  3 harm_test.py's ALL IN ORDER runs the functions in RULES order: same result as clean(doc)?
  4 clean(clean(doc)) == ("keep", clean(doc)): a second run changes nothing
  5 ZWJ U+200D and ZWNJ U+200C: clean() never deletes a joiner on its own

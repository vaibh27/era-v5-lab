"""Task 4: test spec_v1/clean.py with the team's harm_test.py, and write results/spec_v1/cleaner/harm_tests.md.

  python -I make_harm_tests.py <checkout> <packs dir> [<packs dir> ...] [--out <harm_tests.md>] [--results <dir>]

<checkout> holds teams/01-data-a/harmtest/harm_test.py and teams/01-data-a/gold/. harm_test.py is imported as it is, never
changed, and its own functions read the gold, read the pack and count the harm, as validate/validate_specv1.py does.

Each rule is tested alone, only on the gold sets of the packs SCOPE (the table at the top of clean.py) gives it. Then each
disease-code function on every pack where one of its rules applies, and clean() on every pack. Every rule that does not
apply to a pack is also run on that whole pack, and must change nothing: that checks the scope table holds.

A pack's documents get pack_id from the pack; a pack without the column gets its file name, and a pack whose pack_id is
not its file name stops the run. A pack with no file in any <packs dir>, or no gold file, is listed as not run.
Reports are IDs and digests only, never text.

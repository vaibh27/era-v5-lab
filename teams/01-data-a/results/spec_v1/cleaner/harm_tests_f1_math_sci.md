# Spec v1 harm tests

DRAFT. Made by `spec_v1/tools/make_harm_tests.py` on 02 Nov 2026 from `clean.py` (built by `spec_v1/tools/build_clean.py` from `specv1.md`) with the team's `harm_test.py`, run as it is. Each cell: gold docs changed + dropped. Limit: `max(1, floor(1% of gold))`, that is `max(1 document, 1%)` (TSAI decision), each pack on its own gold set, never pooled. An empty gold set is NOT TESTABLE and an error is never a PASS; a result other than PASS is shown after the count.

A rule is tested only on the gold sets of the packs it applies to: its entry in `SCOPE`, the table at the top of `clean.py`. `·` means the rule does not apply to that pack, so it was not run there.

## 1. clean(), the whole cleaner, on each pack

| pack | family | gold docs (limit) | gold changed + dropped | result | whole pack fixed / dropped | rules that do not apply, acting on the whole pack | gold result as `results/cleaner/specv1_validation.json` |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| math-finemath | math | 86 (1) | 0 | PASS | 177 / 13 | none | yes |
| math-megamath | math | 26 (1) | 0 | PASS | 62 / 10 | none | yes |
| sci-finepdfs | sci | 202 (2) | 0 | PASS | 45 / 13 | none | yes |

On the code, math and science packs `clean()` also runs the shared F1 (`spec_v1/tools/f1_rule.py`) last, and `DA-B4-009` leaves `<EMAIL>`: `specv1_validation.json` ran the sheet without them, so these packs may differ from it.

## 2. Each rule alone, on the gold sets of its packs only

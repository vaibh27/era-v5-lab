# ERA V5 Lab: model card outline

**Date:** 3 Nov 2026
**Owner of this outline:** Release

The model card is the public document that describes the model and how the lab made it.
This file lists the sections of the model card.
Each section has an owner team, a status and a lead confirmation.

## How to use this outline

- The owner team writes the text of its section.
- Release edits the text for style and runs `check_style.py` on it.
- TSAI approves the text before it goes into the model card.
- A section can have more than one owner team. The first team named leads the section.

**Status** is one of these:

- **empty:** nobody has written the text yet.
- **in progress:** the owner team is writing the text.
- **approved:** TSAI approved the text.

**Lead OK** tracks whether the lead of each owner team confirmed the section and its scope.
Write `pending` until they confirm. Then write `OK` and the GitHub handle of each lead who confirmed.
For a shared section, name each owner team, for example `Data A OK @handle; Data B pending`.
This confirms the outline only. TSAI still approves the final text.

## Rules for every section

- Write only about work that is done. Do not promise dates, sizes or results.
- Write `[number: waiting for TSAI]` in place of any number that TSAI has not approved.
- Name teams only. Do not name any person.
- Follow `teams/11-release/style/style_guide.md`.

# ERA V5 Lab: run report outline

**Date:** 3 Nov 2026
**Owner of this outline:** Release

The run report is the long public document that explains how the lab built and trained the model.
The V4 run report (https://lightninglm.theschoolofai.in/) is the model for its shape.
This file lists the sections of the run report.
Each section has an owner team, a status and a lead confirmation.

## How to use this outline

- The owner team writes the text of its section.
- Release edits the text for style and runs `check_style.py` on it.
- TSAI approves the text before it goes into the run report.
- A section can have more than one owner team. The first team named leads the section.

**Status** is one of these:

- **empty:** nobody has written the text yet.
- **in progress:** the owner team is writing the text.
- **approved:** TSAI approved the text.

**Lead OK** tracks whether the lead of each owner team confirmed the section and its scope.
Write `pending` until they confirm. Then write `OK` and the GitHub handle of each lead who confirmed.
For a shared section, name each owner team, for example `Data A OK @handle; Data B pending`.
This confirms the outline only. TSAI still approves the final text.

## Review record (remove this section before publishing)

This record is public, like the rest of the pull request. Put only public facts in it: yes or no, and links to
public pull requests. Never link to the CAP chat. Chat links are internal.

How to fill it:

1. Each team sends its proposal by the time TSAI set. Add the public pull request of the proposal below.
2. After TSAI decides, write each decision in the words that TSAI approves.
3. The lead of each team gives an OK on the text about their decision.
4. Write `[number: waiting for TSAI]` for any number that TSAI has not approved yet.
5. Run `python teams/11-release/style/check_style.py <this file> --numbers` and clear every error.
6. Release then copies the approved text to `updates/gate2.md`.

| Team | Proposal pull request | Lead OK |

"""Buffered JSONL metrics writer for the training loop.

One row per completed optimizer step is appended to metrics.jsonl. Rows are held in memory and
written to disk whenever `step % flush_every == 0` (default 10), so a crash loses at most the last 9 steps.
A row with a non-finite value (stored as "nan", "inf" or "-inf") is flushed at once, because that is
the row you want to see after a crash.

Only metrics from the metric list are written; an unknown name (a typo, or a dropped metric such as
`loss` or `loss_by_lane`) is skipped with one warning per name. `gpu_alloc_gb` (the name train.py uses; the value is GiB) is
mapped to `gpu_alloc_gib`, and `temp_c` (the G6 sampler's name) to `gpu_temp_c`. G6's 10-second `gpu_utilization` has no step,
so it is not written here. GPU memory passed as `mem_used_mib` (in MiB, as nvidia-smi reports it) is written as
`gpu_memory_used` in bytes (x 1,048,576); a `gpu_memory_used` value the trainer passes itself wins.

    writer.write(step, loss_ntp=..., mem_used_mib=31009)     # gpu_memory_used = 32515293184.0 bytes (30.28 GiB)

`gradient_clipping_applied` (0 / 1) is worked out from `gradient_norm` (the value clip_grad_norm_ returns, before
clipping) when the trainer also passes `grad_clip`, the threshold: 1 when gradient_norm > grad_clip. The threshold is
not stored. A flag the trainer passes itself wins, and a True / False flag is stored as 1 / 0.

    writer.write(step, loss_ntp=..., gradient_norm=norm, grad_clip=cfg["run"]["grad_clip"])

Three MoE metrics are worked out from `expert_load` when the trainer does not pass them. An expert's utilization is
its share of its layer's picks divided by the uniform share (1 / number of experts): 1.0 is a fair share, 0 is never picked.
- `dead_experts_count`: routed experts, over all MoE layers, with utilization below 0.1.
- `dead_experts_by_layer`: the same count for each MoE layer, in layer order, to show where routing collapses.
- `expert_utilization_min`: the lowest utilization of any routed expert. It falls before an expert is counted as dead,
  so it warns early; below 0.1 the expert is dead.
`expert_load` is one layer (a list of per-expert picks or shares), several layers (a list of lists, or {layer: list}), or a
2-D array or tensor. Counts and shares give the same answer, since each layer is divided by its own total. Pass the
picks of the whole optimizer step, summed over micro-batches and data-parallel ranks: one micro-batch is too small to
call an expert dead.

When `expert_load` is logged, `router_max_vio` (DeepSeek MaxVio, the largest over MoE layers) is
computed from it and written in the same row, unless the caller passed it explicitly. So is
`expert_load_imbalance`, the single summary number from the metric list: busiest expert / average expert
(max(shares) * num_experts) in the worst MoE layer. 1.0 is perfectly balanced; it equals router_max_vio + 1.

`validation_loss` (nats per scored token on the held-out set) is worked out from the result of G5's
`week2.evaluation.evaluate()` when the row has it: `val/nll_nats` (the summed loss) / `val/scored_tokens`. It is the
same quantity as `loss_ntp`, so the two can be compared on one axis, and ln(`val/perplexity`). Only rows from a
validation run carry it. A value the trainer passes itself wins.

    writer.write(step, loss_ntp=..., **evaluate(model, val, ...))     # on the steps that run validation

`validation_bpb` (held-out bits per UTF-8 byte) comes from the same result: `val/nll_nats` / (ln(2) x
`val/utf8_bytes`), G5's `val/bpb`. It does not depend on the tokenizer (bytes are the same for every G3 tokenizer),
so runs with different tokenizers can be compared on one axis; validation_loss cannot. When the two inputs are
missing, G5's own `val/bpb` is used. A value the trainer passes itself wins.

`update_weight_ratio` is the global L2 update-to-weight ratio ||lr * update||_2 / ||W||_2 (one scalar for the
whole model). Call `compute_update_weight_ratio` around the optimizer step and pass the result when it is not
None. By default it only returns a value every 10 steps (`every_n_steps=10`, matching `flush_every`); use
`every_n_steps=1` in tests. A zero or non-finite weight norm yields None so the row gets no ratio instead of a
wrong one.

    ratio = compute_update_weight_ratio(zip(weights, deltas), step=step)
    if ratio is not None:
        writer.write(step, loss_ntp=..., update_weight_ratio=ratio)

`step_with_update_weight_ratio(optimizer, step)` does the same in one line: train.py calls it in place of
`optimizer.step()`, and it returns the ratio of the weights before and after the step (None on other steps).

    ratio = step_with_update_weight_ratio(optimizer, step)     # replaces optimizer.step()

    with MetricsWriter("metrics.jsonl") as writer:
        for step in range(n):
            ...
            writer.write(step, loss_ntp=1.2, loss_mtp=1.4, lr=3e-4)
